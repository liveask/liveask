            the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers
            to post a conspicuous
            privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or
            companies with

            only that individuals
            have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government
            agencies to
            investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
